## Retrospective Analysis
During the project we encountered several challenges that affected team productivity. Communication gaps and differing availability led to missed deadlines and duplicated work. Integrating contributions revealed frequent merge conflicts and inconsistent coding styles, which required extra time for refactoring. Ambiguous requirements and shifting priorities caused rework and unclear task ownership. Tooling and environment discrepancies made local setup and testing difficult for some members. Time management under concurrent commitments limited the depth of reviews and testing. Despite these issues, addressing them through clearer processes, defined coding standards, and more regular syncs helped improve coordination and reduce friction.
Using Git streamlined our collaboration while building the portfolio website. We worked in parallel without overwriting each otherâ€™s code, reviewed changes through pull requests, and resolved conflicts early. Branching improved experimentation, and the shared history gave clarity and accountability. Overall, Git made teamwork faster, safer, and more organized.
- ### Merge conflict
One of the major conflicts that we encountered during our work was the different changes made to the index.html file having so many hands on that file caused some issues we site one conflict specifically which was the merge between amani's branch and the develop branch we could not resolve this conflict in the browser solver we had to take it locally to solve it where we had to track the changes one by one and start from the first line to find the problem but due to the team effort we were able to resolve this issue.
