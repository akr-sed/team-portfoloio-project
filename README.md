## Retrospective Analysis
During the project we encountered several challenges that affected team productivity. Communication gaps and differing availability led to missed deadlines and duplicated work. Integrating contributions revealed frequent merge conflicts and inconsistent coding styles, which required extra time for refactoring. Ambiguous requirements and shifting priorities caused rework and unclear task ownership. Tooling and environment discrepancies made local setup and testing difficult for some members. Time management under concurrent commitments limited the depth of reviews and testing. Despite these issues, addressing them through clearer processes, defined coding standards, and more regular syncs helped improve coordination and reduce friction.
